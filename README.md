# Light-source-and-object-proximity-detector-system
In this project, we developed an embedded system for detecting and monitoring light sources and objects in space. The system runs on the MSP430G2553 microcontroller and integrates an ultrasonic distance sensor, two light-dependent resistors (LDRs), and a servo motor to perform a 180-degree scanning operation.
